            <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
            <p>
                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a virus.
                The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu). You can protect
                yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding
                close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

            <h2>How it spreads</h2>
            <p>
                Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when
                they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that
                has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
